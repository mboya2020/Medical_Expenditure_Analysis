# Medical Expenditure Analysis

## Title and Description

Welcome to the Medical Expenditure Analysis project! This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting the risk of annual healthcare expenditures exceeding $20,000 for subjects that are 40 years and above using the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) dataset.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on the analysis, model development, and interpretation, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook: [Medical_Expenditure_Analysis.ipynb](link-to-your-notebook).[https://github.com/mboya2020/Medical_Expenditure_Analysis/blob/main/Medical_Expenditure_Analysis_.ipynb]

## Deployment

The project can be deployed using the following steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mboya2020/Medical_Expenditure_Analysis.git
   cd Medical_Expenditure_Analysis
   ```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install Required Modules:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Medical_Expenditure_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

   Execute the notebook cells sequentially for a comprehensive analysis.

## Requirements

To run the analysis and Jupyter Notebook successfully, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (specified in the Jupyter Notebook)

## Recommended Modules

The project recommends the following Python modules for a smooth execution:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Medical_Expenditure_Analysis.git
   cd Medical_Expenditure_Analysis
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install required modules:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

No additional configuration is needed. Ensure the NMES dataset (`nmes.txt`) is in the specified directory.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Q: I'm encountering issues with data loading.
- Ensure the dataset (`nmes.txt`) is in the correct directory.
- Check file paths and permissions.

### Q: How do I interpret the ROC AUC scores?
- ROC AUC measures model performance. Higher values indicate better performance.
